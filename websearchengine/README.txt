Changes made:

1) index.html, search.html- Included Bootstrap CDN and used bootstrap classes for input, dropdown and search results. Made changes to the input names accordingly.

2) index.css, search.css- Added some css for alignment of the new elemets

3) views.py- Could not see any output for results after searching keyword. Hence, changed the else condition (after AND/OR). The AND/OR are giving error. Normal search runs correctly.
